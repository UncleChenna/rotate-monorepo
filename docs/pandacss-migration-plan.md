# Performance Metrics After Switching to Panda CSS

This document provides an overview of the performance metrics observed after migrating from Chakra UI to Panda CSS as well as a migration guide.

## Performance Overview

The following metrics were recorded after the migration:

- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: **0.3 s**
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: **3.4 s**
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**: **360 ms**
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: **0.066**
- **Speed Index (SI)**: **0.4 s**
- **Overall Performance Score**: **65**

### Performance Breakdown

- **FCP**: The time taken for the first content to be painted on the screen is 0.3 seconds.
- **LCP**: The time taken for the largest content element to be painted is 3.4 seconds.
- **TBT**: The total time during which the main thread was blocked is 360 milliseconds.
- **CLS**: The cumulative layout shift score is 0.066, indicating minor layout shifts.
- **SI**: The speed index score is 0.4 seconds, representing the time at which the visible parts of the page are displayed.

### Performance Score

The overall performance score is 65, which falls into the "Needs Improvement" range. These values are estimated and may vary.

## Visual Representation

_Values are estimated and may vary. The performance score is calculated directly from these metrics._

Performance score ranges:
- **0–49**: Poor
- **50–89**: Needs Improvement
- **90–100**: Good

# Step 6: Plan for Full Migration to Panda CSS

In this section, I have outlined the strategy for fully migrating the application from Chakra UI to Panda CSS.

## 1. Gradual Migration Strategy

### Approach

- **Component-wise Migration**: Begin by migrating individual components to Panda CSS. Prioritize components that have the most significant impact on performance and user experience.
- **Page-by-Page Migration**: After migrating individual components, focus on migrating entire pages to Panda CSS.
- **Testing at Each Step**: Ensure thorough testing after each component and page migration to identify any issues early.

### Tools

- **Codebase Analysis**: Use tools to analyze the current codebase and identify Chakra UI components that are easy to replace.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuously monitor performance metrics using Lighthouse CI and web-vitals.

## 2. Design System Adaptation

### Strategy

- **Mapping Design Tokens**: Map Chakra UI design tokens to Panda CSS tokens. This ensures consistency in design during the migration.
- **Theming**: Implement a consistent theme using Panda CSS's theming capabilities. Recreate the existing theme from Chakra UI within Panda CSS.
- **Custom Recipes**: Where necessary, create custom recipes in Panda CSS to match specific Chakra UI component styles.

### Implementation

- **Global Styles**: Set up global styles using Panda CSS that replicate the existing design system.
- **Component Library**: Gradually replace the existing Chakra UI-based component library with one that uses Panda CSS.

## 3. Server Components

### Considerations

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Ensure that Panda CSS is fully compatible with Next.js’s SSR features.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Verify that Panda CSS styles are correctly applied in statically generated pages.

### Actions

- **Optimize SSR and SSG**: Test the application’s SSR and SSG performance at each stage of migration to ensure no regressions.
- **Panda CSS Setup**: Ensure that Panda CSS is correctly configured to work with server components.

## 4. Theming

### Theming Strategy

- **Create a Base Theme**: Start by creating a base theme in Panda CSS that matches the current design language.
- **Dark Mode Support**: Implement dark mode support using Panda CSS’s theming capabilities.
- **Customization**: Allow for easy customization and extension of the theme.

### Implementation

- **Theme Provider**: Use Panda CSS’s theme provider to manage theming across the application.
- **Style Consistency**: Ensure style consistency across all components by using the theme provider.

## Conclusion

The plan outlined above provides a structured approach to fully migrating the application from Chakra UI to Panda CSS. By following this strategy, i aim to enhance performance, maintain design consistency, and leverage the benefits of Panda CSS.
